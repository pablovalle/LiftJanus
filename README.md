## General Information

This repository presents the experimental results for the paper "An Industrial Experience Report on Applying Search-based Boundary Input Generation to Cyber-Physical Systems".


## Repository Structure

The package is structured as follows:


* [__Experiments_withDD__](/Experiments_withDD) contains the results of the executions for our approach, the baseline algorithm and the repair algorithm.

* [__Experiments_withoutDD__](/Experiments_withoutDD) contains the results of the executions for our approach without the test input minimization component.

* [__RQ_images__](/RQ_images) contains the images used in the paper.

* [__Scripts__](/Scripts) contains a set of scripts used to analyze the results.
 - LWT.py generates the graphs for Figure 3.
 - experiment_analyzer.m generates the graphs for Figure 4, as well as the statistical tests of the paper.


_Note:_ Matlab 2023b an python are required
